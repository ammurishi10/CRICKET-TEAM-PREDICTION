CRICKET-TEAM-PREDICTION
This project focuses on building a machine learning-based system for selecting a balanced cricket team using player performance data. After cleaning and preprocessing batting, bowling, and fielding statistics, several classification models—including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, and KNN—were trained to predict whether a player should be selected. Among these, the Decision Tree and Random Forest models delivered the highest accuracy, exceeding 99%. The best-performing model was then used to make predictions on unseen data. A custom performance score was calculated by combining batting average, strike rate, wickets, and economy rate. Based on these scores and role classification logic, a balanced playing eleven was formed, consisting of four batters, three all-rounders, and four bowlers. The final team was analyzed using statistical summaries and visualized to understand role distribution and individual contributions, helping ensure optimal team composition.
